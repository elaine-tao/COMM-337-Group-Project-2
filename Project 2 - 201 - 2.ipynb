    "#### 1. Define the Question: \n",
    "\n",
    "One business question we want to solve with generative AI is within the advertising industry. We want to use generative AI to create personalized advertisements that can target every individual consumer differently. Assuming we are a social media platform that generates revenue through selling advertisements, we want to help our clients (for example, a clothing company) create the most effective advertisement that leads to a high sales rate. Considering advertisers already use large amounts of data to determine consumer preference, we believe that using Generative AI can allow advertisers to deliver the right products to the right consumers. The benefits of having customized advertising for each consumer would be increased sales for the products of the business advertising. Using generative AI to create ads would also cut down on the labour costs associated with the creation of advertisements at a large scale. "

    "\n",
    "**Information needed:** \\\n",
    "User data: We need to know what users on our platform want and enjoy. One way to determine user preference is by analyzing their search history and the content users interact with (i.e., “winter outfit ideas”, “what to do in Vancouver winter”).\n",

    "Client’s data: We need to know what the client is trying to sell (i.e., Canada Goose, winter jackets) and images and information of their product\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "What we can do is generate an advertisement video of someone skiing in Whistler wearing a blue Canada Goose jacket, instead of generic videos of someone wearing a yellow winter jacket ice climbing. The consumer will see the video and feel that Canada Goose has exactly what they want, rather than having to go to Canada Goose’s website and manually look for a specific blue ski jacket. \n"

    "#### 3. Discuss Potential Risks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Privacy:** For advertisers to create the most personalized ads, advertisers need to collect a large amount of information about the consumer. Consumers might not be aware their data is being collected and used for advertisement, or used to train AI models, creating mistrust between the parties. Consumers may feel that the ads are too personalized, to the point where the ads become an invasion of privacy, damaging the brand image. For instance, with Canada Goose’s blue winter jacket example, the user may not feel like their privacy is invaded because it is relatively harmless for people to know one likes a blue winter jacket. However, if the product becomes something more personal (i.e., legal service for divorce), *the user may feel like their privacy is violated*. Generative AI is certainly capable of creating an ad video that shows “Hello X, we know you are going through a divorce with your partner, Y law firm get it done fast so you can go back to skiing in Whistler!” These hyper specific ads may have the reverse effect and cause consumers to be turned off from the brands if they feel that their privacy has been violated, which could cause a loss of sales for the advertising firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Technical Challenges:** Generative AI is known for hallucination, which can be problematic if it starts to come up with “fake” images or texts about the product (i.e. Canada Goose’s winter jacket is not fireproof, but AI comes up with footage of people wearing it during fire rescue). The unintended consequences could be that someone will buy these jackets thinking the jacket is fireproof, and wear it during a fire incident, only to be burned to death. This will create liabilities for our clients and our platform. Worse, if Generative AI starts to create biased video ad campaigns (i.e., Only white men wear Canada Goose and ski at Whistler), platform users and companies may leave our platform. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Intellectual Property Rights:** The current legal system is not prepared to deal with work created with generative AI. Generative AI extracts data from the internet to train itself, and the work it produces is derivative of what it has extracted. There is no clear definition of who owns what the AI generates, especially if the end product contains copyrighted material. Referencing back to the Canada Goose example, if generative AI produces an ad campaign that has the face of a celebrity (i.e., Scarlett Johansson wearing Canada Goose) without permission from the celebrity, there is a potential for lawsuits. With the recent Studio Ghibli trend, generative AI may come out with a Ghibli-style ad campaign, placing the campaign in a legally grey area. As a platform creating ad campaigns for clients, turning every campaign into a legal battle will ruin the relationship between platform users and consumers (i.e., clothing companies), eventually ruining the entire business.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Besides legal challenges, content created by generative AI can lack creativity and be plagiaristic. If consumers find the ad campaign boring or is trying to imitate something else, the campaign may not be as effective. Worse, consumers might dislike or boycott the product, ruining the brand’s image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Prevention:** Currently, there is no technique or technology that can absolutely prevent Generative AI from hallucinating, but there are ways to reduce it. Be cautious of the data and footage we use to train the Generative AI, and do not assume it can tell what is “right” or “wrong”. One example is TidePods (turquoise colored detergent balls). There are many videos of people eating TidePods (TidePods challenge), but it does not mean one should eat TidePods. If we rely on the videos on the platform about TidePods, Adobe Firefly may generate ad campaigns of TidePods for consumption (more videos of people eating than washing clothes with it). Instead, we need to provide training data of people using TidePods as detergent balls to generate the desirable ad campaign. Besides providing high-quality data, having humans verify the final output is equally important. Since there is no guarantee AI will always generate what we want, having human reviewers can ensure that unwanted output is filtered or corrected. "
